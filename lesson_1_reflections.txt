It was nice to see the diff between two versions of a file
because then I didn't need to go line by line by myself 
to figure it out.

Sometimes you realize your original approach was accurate
so it is nice to be able to go back and see what you did.
Especially with coding, you could add code and find a bug
so it is nice to go back and see what went wrong.

The pros of manually choosing when to commit include making
sure that they are efficient and that you don't have too many
or too little commits.  The con is that you might forget to 
commit before it is too late and it might come back to bite you.

Files using git typically need multiple files together to work.
Google docs do not rely on other files so they can be treated
separately

Git log will give you a history of all the commits done to that
file.  Then you can grab two ids you're interested in and use
git diff to find the differences between the two files.

Version control is nice so that you can make changes without fear
of screwing something up.  If you make a change that messes with the code
you can easily go back and fix it.

I want to use Git to get a new job.
